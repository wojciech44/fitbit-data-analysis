## Sleep data analysis

### Data structure

By using `sleep_inventory_parser.R` we created to `sleep_data` list object, which contains information such as:
```{r}
summary(sleep_data)
```

```{r}
sleep_data$device_temperature
```

### Write to CSV

By using `placeholder.R` we can generate CSV file each of the items from `aleep_data`- this step is optional.
